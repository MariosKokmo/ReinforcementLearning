# ReinforcementLearning
A repository for training and demonstrative purposes

In the following chapters we will try to implement different AI agents using a variety of algorithms.
The mini-projects will be based on the development timeline in the book of Sutton and Barto.

The Tic-Tac-Toe game consists of an RL-trained agent that becomes able to play the game through
gaining experience while playing against a similar agent-copy of itself. Once trained, the agent
can play against the human player.
The project consists of three classes (agent, human, environment).
The rules are simple and well-known, you have to put 3 of your own symbols in a row whether that is a proper row,
column, or one of the diagonals.
The board is a classic 3 by 3, but can be easily modifies to be a larger one. In that case the game takes longer, but
the difficulty remains the same.
